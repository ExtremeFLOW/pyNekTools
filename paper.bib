abstract = {A spectral element method that combines the generality of the finite element method with the accuracy of spectral techniques is proposed for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.}

abstract = {We detail our developments in the high-fidelity spectral-element code Neko that are essential for unprecedented large-scale direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence. Major innovations are modular multi-backend design enabling performance portability across a wide range of GPUs and CPUs, a GPU-optimized preconditioner with task overlapping for the pressure-Poisson equation and in-situ data compression. We carry out initial runs of Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard Convection (RBC) at extreme scale on the LUMI and Leonardo supercomputers. We show how Neko is able to strongly scale to 16,384 GPUs and obtain results that are not possible without careful consideration and optimization of the entire simulation workflow. These developments in Neko will help resolving the long-standing question regarding the ultimate regime in RBC.},

abstract = {MPI for Python provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language and allows any Python program to exploit multiple processors. This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1 specification and defines an object-oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of general Python objects. Efficiency has been tested in a Beowulf class cluster and satisfying results were obtained. MPI for Python is open source and available for download on the web (http://www.cimec.org.ar/python).}
