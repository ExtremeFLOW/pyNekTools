# Reduced order modelling

In these examples we show how one can use some wrapper functions to perform POD on data in the disk.

The wrapper functions generally use classes that are part of the rom submodule. If you wish to use them in a different way, you can check the steps followed in the wrappers.

1. POD in physical space.
2. POD performing FFT in one homogenous direction.
